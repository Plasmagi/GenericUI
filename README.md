# GenericUI
A constantly-evolving UI based entirely around my whims.
I will generally include an ElvUI profile, character settings and a Plater profile.

This UI is generally built around a few principles:
- Minimalism
  - The more of the game world I can see, the better.
- Clean design
  - I like clean, basic and rounded designs, with a few solid colours.
- Functional
  - Everything needs to be in a position that makes sense for the overall UI layout - centered if it's important, off to side if it's necessary, and hidden if not.
- Generic
  - It's called Generic UI because it's designed around using other WeakAura packs and addons around the very basics of this. By default, it will work for every class and spec with additional WeakAuras to support it.
